The stock market is where these shares are bought and sold.\n\nKey concepts:\n- Stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ) provide platforms for trading\n- Market participants include individual investors, institutions, brokers, and market makers\n- Trading hours typically follow market sessions (pre-market, regular hours, after-hours)\n- Basic terminology includes bid, ask, spread, volume, and market cap\n\nUnderstanding these fundamentals is essential for anyone looking to invest in stocks.",

Key points about exchanges:\n\nThey provide platforms for companies to raise capital by issuing shares in the primary market (e.g., IPOs).\n\nAfter issuance, shares trade in the secondary market where investors buy and sell among themselves.\n\nExchanges match buy and sell orders electronically or on physical trading floors (e.g., NYSE).\n\nExchanges rely on market makers to maintain liquidity and facilitate smooth price discovery.\n\nExamples of major exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, and many others worldwide.\n\nExchanges charge transaction fees for facilitating trades.\n\nTogether, these market participants and exchanges create a dynamic ecosystem where capital flows efficiently from investors to companies, supporting economic growth and investment opportunities for the public.
